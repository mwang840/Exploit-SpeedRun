An exploit script for pwning

Overall this class got me out of my comfort zone a lot. Earlier in the class, I seem to struggle once we got into the reversing problems, but quickly found a way to figure out the issue and seek help when needed from the experts such as Cam, you and other people who understand the reversing. Once that issue was resolved, I still had some struggles picking up ropchaining, glibc leaks, printf vuln and much more challenging but fun exploits. The best exploit that caught my eye was Moms spaghetti, the dawn of my not-so good house analogies. I enjoyed the tools utilized such as pwntools, radare2 and gdb. Practicing moms spaghetti came with struggles but I enjoyed doing it and starting to get the basics of that concepts. Even though not all of the speedruns will be completed by the end of this semester, I did put in the effort in this project and the extension to moms spaghetti, I enjoyed a lot. I also asked questions in class when things didn't make sense and also continue to debug my code when getting EOF from my exploits. Overall I enjoyed this class and this class brought me into CTF and cyber more and opened up my interest in cyber for the forseeable future. It took me some time to come up with mental models, but once I had an mental model  where I can relate to the technical side of things, I slowly but surely understood the topic.
